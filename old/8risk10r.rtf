The sun had set behind the mountains, and the rich plain of Athens was suffused with the violet glow of a Grecian eye.  A light breeze rose; the olive-groves awoke from their noonday trance, and rustled with retur
ning animation, and the pennons of the Turkish squadron, that lay at anchor in the harbour of Pir\'e6
us, twinkled in the lively air.  From one gate of the city the women came forth in procession to the fountain; from another, a band of sumptuous horsemen sall
ied out, and threw their wanton javelins in the invigorating sky, as they galloped over the plain.  The voice of birds, the buzz of beauteous insects, the breath of fragrant flowers, the quivering note of the nightingale, the pattering call of the grassho
pper, and the perfume of the violet, shrinking from the embrace of the twilight breeze, filled the purple air with music and with odour.

zed upon the inspiring scene.  Around him rose the matchless memorials of antique art; immortal columns whose symmetry baffles modern proportion, serene Caryatides, bearing with greater grace a graceful burthen, carvings of delicate precision, and friezes
 
breathing with heroic life.  Apparently the stranger, though habited as a Moslemin, was not insensible to the genius of the locality, nor indeed would his form and countenance have misbecome a contemporary of Pericles and Phidias.  In the prime of life an
d
 far above the common stature, but with a frame the muscular power of which was even exceeded by its almost ideal symmetry, white forehead, his straight profile, his oval countenance, and his curling lip, exhibited the same visage that had inspired the sc

The dress of the stranger, although gorgeous, was, however, certainly not classic.  A crimson shawl was wound round his head and glittered with a trembling aigrette of diamonds.  His vest which set tight to his f
orm, was of green velvet, richly embroidered with gold and pearls.  Over this he wore a very light jacket of crimson velvet, equally embroidered, and lined with sable.  He wore also the full white camese common among the Albanians; and while his feet were
 
protected by sandals, the lower part of his legs was guarded by greaves of embroidered green velvet.  From a broad belt of scarlet leather peeped forth the jewelled hilts of a variety of daggers, and by his side was an enormous scimitar, in a scabbard of 
chased silver.

I am at least a warrior; and this arm, though trained to war against thee, will not well forget, in the quick hour of battle, the blood that flows within it.  Themistocles saved Greece and died a Satrap: I am bred one, let me reverse our lots, and die at

Iskander was the youngest son of the Prince of Epirus, who, with the other Grecian princes, had, at the commencement of the reign of Amurath the Second, in vain resisted the progress of the Turkish arms in Europe.  The Prince of Epirus had obtained peace 
b

ist the opportunity that then offered itself of adding to his empire the rich principality he had long coveted.  A Turkish force instantly marched into Epirus, and seized upon Croia, the capital city, and the children of its late ruler were doomed to deat

riors, he became a prime favourite of the Sultan, and speedily rose in his service to the highest rank.

Had Iskander been influenced by vulgar ambition, his loftiest desires might have been fully gratified by the career which Amurath projected for him.  The Turkish Sultan destined for the Grecian Prince the hand of one of his daughter
s, and the principal command of his armies.  He lavished upon him the highest dignities and boundless wealth; and, whether it arose from a feeling of remorse, or of affection for a warrior whose unexampled valour and unrivalled skill had already added som
e
 of the finest provinces of Asia to his rule, it is certain that Iskander might have exercised over Amurath a far greater degree of influence than was enjoyed by any other of his courtiers.  But the heart of Iskander responded with no sympathy to these fl
a
ttering favours.  His Turkish education could never eradicate from his memory the consciousness that he was a Greek; and although he was brought up in the Moslemin faith, he had at an early period of his career, secretly recurred to the creed of his Chris
t
ian fathers.  He beheld in Amurath the murderer of his dearest kinsmen, and the oppressor of his country; and although a certain calmness of temper, and coolness of judgment, which very early developed themselves in his character, prevented him from ever 
giving any indication of his secret feelings, Iskander had long meditated on the exalted duty of freeing his country.

nuchs, his priests, and his courtiers, he envied Leonidas, and would have emulated Themistocles.  He was passionately devoted to the ancient literature of his country, and had the good taste, rare at that time, to prefer Demosthenes and Lysias to Chrysost
o
m and Gregory, and the choruses of the Grecian theatre to the hymns of the Greek church.  The sustained energy and noble simplicity of the character of Iskander, seemed to recall to the young prince the classic heroes over whom he was so often musing, whi

us, and all that apparent weakness of will, and those quick vicissitudes of emotion, to which men of a fine susceptibility are subject, equally engaged the sympathy of the more vigorous and constant and experienced mind of his companion.

parting of friends, united by sympathetic tastes, is always painful; and friends, unless this sympathy subsist, had much better never meet.  Iskander stepped into the ship, sorrowful, but serene; Nic\'e6

Iskander returned to his men.  Night was coming on.  Fires and lights blazed and sparkled in every direction.  The air was clear, but very cold.  He entered his tent, and muffling himself up in his pelisse of sabl
es, he mounted his horse, and declining any attendance, rode for some little distance, until he had escaped from the precincts of the camp.  Then he turned his horse towards one of the wildest passes of the mountain, and galloping at great speed, never st
o
pped until he had gained a considerable ascent.  The track became steep and rugged.  The masses of loose stone rendered his progress slow; but his Anatolian charger still bore him at intervals bravely, and in three hours' time he had gained the summit of 
Mount H\'e6mus.  A brilliant moon flooded the broad plains of Bulgaria with shadowy light.  At the base of the mountainous range, the red watch-fires denoted the situation of the Christian camp.

\faauto\ls7\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f1\cgrid0 Now Iskander was very anxious t
o effect the removal of these garrisons without loss of time, in order that if Amurath sent a great power against him, as he expected, the invading army might have nothing to rely upon but its own force, and that his attention might not in any way be dive
r
ted from effecting their overthrow.  Therefore, as soon as his troops had rested, and he had formed his new recruits into some order, which, with their willing spirits, did not demand many days, Iskander set out from Croia, at the head of twelve thousand 
m
en, and marched against the strong city of Petrella, meeting in his way the remainder of the garrison of Croia on their return, who surrendered themselves to him at discretion.  Petrella was only one day's march from Croia, and when Iskander arrived there
 
he requested a conference with the governor, and told his tale so well, representing the late overthrow of the Turks by Hunniades, and the incapacity of Amurath at present to relieve him, that the Turkish commander agreed to deliver up the place, and leav
e
 the country with his troops, particularly as the alternative of Iskander to these easy terms was ever conquest without quarter.  And thus, by a happy mixture of audacity and adroitness, the march of Iskander throughout Epirus was rather like a triumph th
a
n a campaign, the Turkish garrisons imitating, without any exception, the conduct of their comrades at Petrella, and dreading the fate of their comrades at the capital.  In less than a month Iskander returned to Epirus, having delivered the whole country 
from the Moslemin yoke.

but, indeed, it required less skill than herself and her advisers had at first imagined.  Her malady, although it might have ended fatally, was in its origin entirely mental, and the sudden prospect of freedom, and of restoration to her country and her fa
m
ily, at a moment when she had delivered herself up to despair, afforded her a great and instantaneous benefit.  She could not, indeed, sufficiently restrain her spirits, and smiled incredulously when Iskander mentioned the impending exertion and fatigues 
w
ith doubt and apprehension.  His anxiety to return immediately to Epirus, determined him to adopt the measures for her rescue without loss of time, and on his third visit, he prepared her for making the great attempt on the ensuing morn.  Hitherto Iskande
r
 had refrained from revealing himself to Iduna.  He was induced to adopt this conduct by various considerations.  He could no longer conceal from himself that the daughter of Hunniades exercised an influence over his feelings which he was unwilling to enc
ourage.  His sincere friendship for Nic\'e6
us, and his conviction that It was his present duty to concentrate all his thought and affection in the cause of his country, would have rendered him anxious to have resisted any emotions of the kind, even could he ha
ve flattered himself that there was any chance of their being returned by the object of his rising passion.  But Iskander was as modest as he was brave and gifted.  The disparity of age between himself and Iduna appeared an insuperable barrier to his hope
s
, even had there been no other obstacle.  Iskander struggled with his love, and with his strong mind the struggle, though painful, was not without success.  He felt that he was acting in a manner which must ultimately tend to the advantage of his country,
 the happiness of his friend, and perhaps the maintenance of his own self-respect.  For he had too much pride not to be very sensible to the bitterness of rejection.

us and Iduna, he would perhaps not have persisted in maintaining his disguise.  But he had long suspected that the passion of the Prince of Athens was not too favourably considered by the daughter of Hunniades, and he was therefore exceedingly anxious t
hat Nic\'e6us should possess all the credit of the present adventure, which Iskander scarcely doubted, if successful, would allow Nic\'e6
us to urge irresistible claims to the heart of a mistress whom he had rescued at the peril of his life from slavery and disho
nour, to offer rank, reputation, and love.  Iskander took, therefore, several opportunities of leading Iduna to believe that he was merely the confidential agent of Nic\'e6
us, and that the whole plan of her rescue from the Seraglio of Adrianople bad been planned by his young friend.  In the meantime, during the three days on which they had for short intervals met, very few words had been interchanged between Nic\'e6
us and his mistress.  Those words, indeed, had been to him of the most inspiring nature, and expressed such a deep scale of gratitude, and such lively regard, that Nic\'e6
us could no longer resist the delightful conviction that he had at length created a permanent interest in her heart.  Often he longed to rush to her couch, and press her hand to his lips.
  Even the anticipation of future happiness could not prevent him from envying the good fortune of Iskander, who was allowed to converse with her without restraint; and bitterly, on their return to the khan, did he execrate the pompous eunuch for all the 
torture which he occasioned him by his silly conversation, and the petty tyranny of office with which Kaflis always repressed his attempts to converse for a moment with Iduna.

ed by Kaflis to the chamber of the tower, who congratulated Iskander on their way on the rapid convalescence of the captive.  When they had fairly entered the chamber, the physician being somewhat in advance, Nic\'e6
us, who was behind, commenced proceedings by
 knocking down the eunuch, and Iskander instantly turning round to his assistance, they succeeded in gagging and binding the alarmed and astonished Kaflis.  Iduna then exhibited herself in a costume exactly similar to that worn by Nic\'e6
us, and which her fri
ends had brought to her in their big.  Iskander and Iduna then immediately quitted the Serail without notice or suspicion, and hurried to the khan, where they mounted their horses, that were in readiness, and hastened without a moment's loss of time to a 
fountain without the gates, where they awaited the arrival of Nic\'e6
us with anxiety.  After remaining a few minutes in the chamber of the tower, the Prince of Athens stole out, taking care to secure the door upon Kaflis, he descended the staircase, and escape
d through the Serail without meeting any one, and had nearly reached the gate of the gardens, when he was challenged by some of the eunuch guard at a little distance.

By nightfall they had reached a small wood of chestnut-trees, where they rested for two hours, more for the sake of their steeds than their own refreshment, for anxiety prevented Iduna from indulging in any repose, as much as
 excitement prevented her from feeling any fatigue.  Iskander lit a fire and prepared their rough meal, unharnessed the horses, and turned them out to their pasture.  Nic\'e6

In the meantime let us not forget the Prince of Athens and the Lady Iduna.  These adventurous companions soon lost sight of their devoted champion, and entered a winding ravine, which gradually brought them to the
 summit of the first chain of the Epirot mountains.  From it they looked down upon a vast and rocky valley, through which several mule tracks led in various directions, and entered the highest barrier of the mountains, which rose before them covered with 
forests of chestnut and ilex.  Nic\'e6
us chose the track which he considered least tempting to pursuit, and towards sunset they had again entered a ravine washed by a mountain stream.  The course of the waters had made the earth fertile and beautiful.  Wild sh
rubs of gay and pleasant colours refreshed their wearied eye-sight, and the perfume of aromatic plants invigorated their jaded senses.  Upon the bank of the river, too, a large cross of roughly-carved wood brought comfort to their Christian hearts, and wh

us the reason which had induced alike him and Iskander to pre
serve so strictly the disguise of his companion.  But a feeling which she did not choose to analyse struggled successfully with her curiosity: she felt a reluctance to speak of Iskander to the Prince of Athens.  In the meantime Nic\'e6

\faauto\ls13\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f1\cgrid0 But repose fell not upon the eye-lids of Nic\'e6us in spite of all labours.  The heart of the Athenian Prince was distracted by two most power
ful of passions -- Love and Jealousy -- and when the Eremite, pointing out to his guest his allotted resting-place, himself retired to his regular and simple slumbers, Nic\'e6
us quitted the cavern, and standing upon the bank of the river, gazed in abstraction
 upon the rushing waters foaming in the moonlight.  The Prince of Athens, with many admirable qualities, was one of those men who are influenced only by their passions, and who, in the affairs of life, are invariably guided by their imagination instead of
 
their reason.  At present all thought and feeling, all considerations, and all circumstances, merged in the overpowering love he entertained for Iduna, his determination to obtain her at all cost and peril, and his resolution that she should never again m
eet Iskander, except as the wife of Nic\'e6
us.  Compared with this paramount object, the future seemed to vanish.  The emancipation of his country, the welfare of his friend, even the maintenance of his holy creed, all those great and noble objects for which, 
under other circumstances, he would have been prepared to sacrifice his fortune and his life, no longer interested or influenced him; and while the legions of the Crescent were on the point of pouring into Greece to crush that patriotic and Christian caus
e over which Iskander and himself had so often mused, whose interests the disinterested absence of Iskander, occasioned solely by his devotion to Nic\'e6
us, had certainly endangered, and perhaps, could the events of the last few hours be known, even sacrificed
, the Prince of Athens resolved, unless Iduna would consent to become his, at once to carry off the daughter of Hunniades to some distant country.  Nor indeed, even with his easily excited vanity, was Nic\'e6
us sanguine of obtaining his purpose by less violen
t means.  He was already a rejected suitor, and under circumstances which scarcely had left hope.  Nothing but the sole credit of her chivalric rescue could perhaps have obtained for him the interest in the heart of Iduna which he coveted.  For while this
 
exploit proffered an irresistible claim to her deepest gratitude, it indicated also, on the part of her deliverer, the presence and possession of all those great qualities, the absence of which in the character and conduct of her suitor, Iduna had not, at
 
a former period, endeavoured to conceal to be the principal came of his rejection.  And now, by the unhappy course of circumstances, the very deed on which he counted, with sanguine hope, as the sure means of his success, seemed as it were to have placed 
h
im in a more inferior situation than before.  The constant society of his mistress had fanned to all its former force and ardour, the flame which, apart from her, and hopeless, he had endeavoured to repress; while, on the other hand, he could not conceal 
f
rom himself, that Iduna must feel that he had played in these rest proceeding but a secondary part; that all the genius and all the generosity of the exploit rested with Iskander, who, after having obtained her freedom by so much energy, peril, sagacity a
nd skill, had secured it by a devoted courage which might shame all the knights of Christendom; perhaps, too, had secured it by his own life.

The fair Iduna, after all her perils and sufferings, was at length sheltered in safety under a kind and domestic roof.  Alexina, and Helena, and Lais, and all the other sisters emulated each other in the attentions which they lavished upon the tw
o brothers, but especially the youngest.  Their kindness, indeed, was only equalled by their ceaseless curiosity, and had they ever waited for the answers of Iduna to their questions, the daughter of Hunniades might, perhaps, have been somewhat puzzled to
 
reconcile her responses with probability.  Helena answered the questions of Alexina; Lais anticipated even Helena.  All that Iduna had to do was to smile and be silent, and it was universally agreed that Iskander was singularly shy as well as excessively 
handsome.  In the meantime, when Nic\'e6
us met Iduna in the evening of the second day of their visit, he informed her that he had been so fortunate as to resume an acquaintance with an old companion in arms in the person of a neighbouring noble, who had invite
d them to rest at his castle at the end of their next day's journey.  He told her likewise that he had dispatched a courier to Croia to inquire after Iskander, who, he expected, in the course of a few days, would bring them intelligence to guide their fut
ure movements, and decide whether they should at once proceed to the capital of Epirus, or advance into Bulgaria, in case Hunniades was still in the field.  On the morrow, therefore, they proceeded on their journey.  Nic\'e6
us had procured a litter for Iduna, for which her delicate health was an excuse to Alexina and her sisters, and they were attended by a small body of well-armed cavalry, for, according to the accounts which Nic\'e6
us had received, the country was still disturbed.  They departed at break of day, Nic\'e6
us riding by the side of the litter, and occasionally making the most anxious inquiries after the well-being of his fair charge.  An hour after noon they rested at a well, surrounded by olive-trees, until the extreme heat was somewhat allayed; and the
n remounting, proceeded in the direction of an undulating ridge of green hills, that partially intersected the wide plain.  Towards sunset the Prince of Athens withdrew the curtains of the litter, and called the attention of Iduna to a very fair castle, r

A flourish of trumpets announced the return of the Lady Iduna and the Prince of Athens, magnificently attired, came forward with a smile, and led her, with a compliment on her resuming the dress of her se
x, if not of her country, to the banquet.  Iduna was not uninfluenced by that excitement which is insensibly produced by a sudden change of scene and circumstances, and especially by an unexpected transition from hardship, peril, and suffering, to luxury,
 security, and enjoyment.  Their spirits were elevated and gay: she smiled upon Nic\'e6
us with a cheerful sympathy.  They feasted, they listened to sweet music, they talked over their late adventures, and, animated by their own enjoyment, they became more sanguine as to the fate of Iskander.

in so ruinous a state, that the light freely made its way, was the only barrier against the elements.  Iduna, seizing the handle which remained, at once drew it open with little difficulty.

Ere the dawn had broken, the Christian power was in motion.  Iskander commanded the centre, Hunniades the right wing.  The left was entrusted at his urgent request to the Prince of Athens.  A mist that hung about the plain allowed Nic\'e6
us to charge the right wing of the Turks almost unperceived.  He charged with irresistible fury, and soon disordered the ranks of the Moslemin.  Mahomed with the reserve hastened to their aid.  A mighty multitude of Janissaries, shouting the name of
 Allah and his Prophet, penetrated the Christian centre.  Hunniades endeavoured to attack them on their flank, but was himself charged by the Turkish cavalry.  The battle was now general, and raged with terrible fury.  Iskander had secreted in his centre,
 
a new and powerful battery of cannon, presented to him by the Pope, and which had just arrived from Venice.  This battery played upon the Janissaries with great destruction.  He himself mowed them down with his irresistible scimitar.  Infinite was the sla
u
ghter! awful the uproar!  But of all the Christian knights this day, no one performed such mighty feats of arms as the Prince of Athens.  With a reckless desperation he dashed about the field, and everything seemed to yield to his inspired impulse.  His e
x
ample animated his men with such a degree of enthusiasm, that the division to which he was opposed, although encouraged by the presence of Mahomed himself, could no longer withstand the desperate courage of the Christians, and fled in all directions.  The
n, rushing to the aid of Iskander, Nic\'e6

ho were little prepared for such a demonstration of strength on the part of their adversaries.  In a few minutes, their order seemed generally broken, and their leaders in vain endeavoured to rally them.  Waving his bloody scimitar, and bounding on his bl
ack charger, Iskander called upon his men to secure the triumph of the Cross and the freedom of Epirus.  Pursuit was now general.
